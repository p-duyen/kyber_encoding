	abstract="This report studies timing attacks on NTRUEncrypt based on variation in the number of hash calls made on decryption. The attacks apply to the parameter sets of [8,6]. To mount the attacker, an attacker performs a variable amount of precomputation, then submits a relatively small number of specially constructed ciphertexts for decryption and measures the decryption times. Comparison of the decryption times with the precomputed data allows the attacker to recover the key in greatly reduced time compared to standard attacks on NTRUEncrypt. The precomputed data can be used for all keys generated with a specific parameter set and tradeoffs exist that increase the amount of precomputation in order to decrease the time required to recover an individual key. For parameter sets in [3] that claim k-bit security but are vulnerable to this attack, we find that an attacker can typically recover a single key with about k/2 bits of effort.",

	abstract="Masking is a well-known countermeasure to protect block cipher implementations against side-channel attacks. The principle is to randomly split every sensitive intermediate variable occurring in the computation into d{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}1 shares, where d is called the masking order and plays the role of a security parameter. Although widely used in practice, masking is often considered as an empirical solution and its effectiveness is rarely proved. In this paper, we provide a formal security proof for masked implementations of block ciphers. Specifically, we prove that the information gained by observing the leakage from one execution can be made negligible (in the masking order). To obtain this bound, we assume that every elementary calculation in the implementation leaks a noisy function of its input, where the amount of noise can be chosen by the designer (yet linearly bounded). We further assume the existence of a leak-free component that can refresh the masks of shared variables. Our work can be viewed as an extension of the seminal work of Chari et al.published at CRYPTO in 1999 on the soundness of combining masking with noise to thwart side-channel attacks.",

	abstract = {Under normality and homoscedasticity assumptions, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is known to be optimal in terms of minimising the Bayes error for binary classification. In the heteroscedastic case, LDA is not guaranteed to minimise this error. Assuming heteroscedasticity, we derive a linear classifier, the Gaussian Linear Discriminant (GLD), that directly minimises the Bayes error for binary classification. In addition, we also propose a local neighbourhood search (LNS) algorithm to obtain a more robust classifier if the data is known to have a non-normal distribution. We evaluate the proposed classifiers on two artificial and ten real-world datasets that cut across a wide range of application areas including handwriting recognition, medical diagnosis and remote sensing, and then compare our algorithm against existing LDA approaches and other linear classifiers. The GLD is shown to outperform the original LDA procedure in terms of the classification accuracy under heteroscedasticity. While it compares favourably with other existing heteroscedastic LDA approaches, the GLD requires as much as 60 times lower training time on some datasets. Our comparison with the support vector machine (SVM) also shows that, the GLD, together with the LNS, requires as much as 150 times lower training time to achieve an equivalent classification accuracy on some of the datasets. Thus, our algorithms can provide a cheap and reliable option for classification in a lot of expert systems.}

	abstract="In a recent work, Mangard et al. showed that under certain assumptions, the (so-called) standard univariate side-channel attacks using a distance-of-means test, correlation analysis and Gaussian templates are essentially equivalent. In this paper, we show that in the context of multivariate attacks against masked implementations, this conclusion does not hold anymore. While a single distinguisher can be used to compare the susceptibility of different unprotected devices to first-order DPA, understanding second-order attacks requires to carefully investigate the information leakages and the adversaries exploiting these leakages, separately. Using a framework put forward by Standaert et al. at Eurocrypt 2009, we provide the first analysis that explores these two topics in the case of a masked implementation exhibiting a Hamming weight leakage model. Our results lead to refined intuitions regarding the efficiency of various practically-relevant distinguishers. Further, we also investigate the case of second- and third-order masking (i.e. using three and four shares to represent one value). This evaluation confirms that higher-order masking only leads to significant security improvements if the secret sharing is combined with a sufficient amount of noise. Eventually, we show that an information theoretic analysis allows determining this necessary noise level, for different masking schemes and target security levels, with high accuracy and smaller data complexity than previous methods.",

	abstract="During the last 15 years there have been intensive research efforts in constructing cryptographic algorithms resilient to the side-channel leakage. The most fundamental part of every such construction are the leakage-resilient encoding schemes. Usually the cryptographic secrets encoded by them are assumed to belong to some finite group {\$}{\$}({\backslash}mathbb {\{}G{\}},+){\$}{\$}(G,+). The most common encoding scheme is the n-out-of-n additive secret sharing: a secret X is encoded as {\$}{\$}(X{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots ,X{\_}n){\$}{\$}(X1,{\ldots},Xn)such that {\$}{\$}X{\_}1 + {\backslash}cdots X{\_}n = X{\$}{\$}X1+⋯Xn=X. Intuitively, if an adversary receives only small partial independent information about each {\$}{\$}X{\_}i{\$}{\$}Xithen his information about X should be even smaller, and should decrease (i.e. the noise should amplify) when n grows. However, of course, the concrete parameters (the amount of leakage that can be tolerated, and the number of shares needed to achieve a given level of security) depend on the exact model that is used.",
